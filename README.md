# Bachelor Thesis on "Forecast based deep anomaly detection on time series" by Christoph Altherr

This repository contains the files necessary to reproduce the figures and results of the thesis.

Run eurusd_cnn_fixed_threshold.py to get the results for the CNN on the EUR/USD exchange rate with a fixed threshold. (Figure 3.2)<br/>
Run synthetic.py to get the results for CNN on the synthetic data set. (Figure 3.3) <br/>
Run eurusd.py to get the results for the CNN on the EUR/USD exchange rate with the dynamic threshold. (Figure 3.4) <br/>
Run eurusd_one_class_svm.py to get the results for the One-Class SVM on the EUR/USD exchange rate. (Figure 3.5 )<br/>)<br/>


(You can run dataloader.py to get the most recent EUR/USD exchange rate. This might change the figures and results.)
