Run eurusd.py to get the results for the CNN on the EUR/USD exchange rate with the dynamic threshold. <br/>
Run eurusd_cnn_fixed_threshold.py to get the results for the CNN on the EUR/USD exchange rate with a fixed threshold. <br/>
Run eurusd_one_class_svm.py to get the results for the One-Class SVM on the EUR/USD exchange rate. <br/>
Run synthetic.py to get the results for CNN on the synthetic data set. <br/><br/>

(You can run dataloader.py to get the most recent EUR/USD exchange rate. This might change the figures and results.)
